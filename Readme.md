# Pro Javascript Techniques
## An index of JS techniques & Experiments

I decided to create this project after Christmas, because I got the book of John Resig "Pro Javascript Techniques" ![bookpic](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512Smg0xM9L._SL160_.jpg)
I hope this github project could help some of you to discover the power of Javascript, and who knows, maybe you'll love it !
