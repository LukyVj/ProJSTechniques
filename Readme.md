# Pro Javascript Techniques
## An index of JS techniques & Experiments

I decided to create this project after Christmas, because I got the book of John Resig "Pro Javascript Techniques" "![](http://i.bookfi.org/covers/28000/0d9278da49b9d232f79baf42145b0800-d.jpg =250x)"
I hope this github project could help some of you to discover the power of Javascript, and who knows, maybe you'll love it !
